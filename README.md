# BlackGround: An ATProto-Based Social Media Platform

BlackGround is a social media application built on the AT Protocol, inspired by the Statusphere example. It enables users to:

Sign in using OAuth authentication
Retrieve user profile information
Monitor the network firehose for real-time updates
Publish content on user accounts using a custom schema

This project aims to create a functional, federated social media platform that integrates seamlessly with the AT Protocol Network.
